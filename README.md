# Lab-3

For this lab most of my design choices were made to try and keep it simple while also applying concepts I learned about media queries. I used 2 media queries for this lab, one for smaller screens and one for larger ones. I made a lot of use of pseudo elements and classes, including :lastchild, :hover, and :root. 

I made use of variables to keep contained colors that I frequently used throughout the website. this made it easier to know and use the colors.

I used and imported a custom font from google fonts as well as I thought it matched the overall feel I wanted for this website. 

Flex and Grid were both used, which def was a hassle at first but the more I learn about them - especially grid - the more I understand how to use them.

I made sure to minimize the use of px for important things, instead using vh and vw and % to keep them better and in my belief more responsive. 

I chose to keep the nav bar in a position: fixed state as that allowed it to stay in the screen no matter whether the user scrolled down or not. 

It was certainly challenging to use media queries to accomplish all this, especially considering this is the first time using it.

For media like songs, I decided to iframe the spotify embed inside the website as to not have any issues downloading songs off the internet and it also makes it easier for a lot of users (if this site would ever see the light of day) to add the songs directly to their spotify playlist.

I made the cards hoverable on the large screen (desktops + laptops, etc) to make them more appealing and to add more style to this simple website. I didnt add any hover effect to the small screen (mobile) as in my mind it would make sense for the user to hover their finger over the cards, as the finger would only touch the screen to scroll down.

Overall it was a nice first time using media queries, definitely a lot to improve.
